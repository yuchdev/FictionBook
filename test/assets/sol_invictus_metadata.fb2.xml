<annotation>
<p>Sasha is a progressive Moscow blonde. She is in her thirties, there is no virus on the horizon yet, and she is going on a journey promised to her by Shiva himself on the sacred Indian mountain Arunachala.</p>
<p>Sasha will meet historians-necroempaths, Roman princeps, American corporate anarchists, Turkish philologists-Sufis, Cuban sex-workers, and other interesting people (and not only people). But most importantly, she will touch the Great Mystery - and see what Elon Musk calls "computer simulation", and what the Holy Church calls "the God's Creation".</p>
<p>You will learn what Sasha became after meeting the Mystery from the book. What the Mystery became after meeting Sasha, you are already somewhat aware of.</p>
